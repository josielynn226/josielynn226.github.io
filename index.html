    <p>1. Lelouch: Code Geass </p>
    <img src = "Lelouch.png" alt = "Lelouch"
    width = 400
    height = 300 />
    <p>Man, I love a character that starts off as someone trying to do good and then gets consumed by their own ego (similar to Light from Death Note). They are very similar,
    going from the misunderstood hero fighting against a corrupt system to the villain of the story. Someone with narcissistic tendencies starting
    off as the good guy is almost never going to end well, the Lelouch captures this perfectly.</p>

   <p> SHE COULD HAVE BEEN SO GOOD!!! She's calculated, doesn't care about people and pretty much only sees them as pawns, and is, quite frankly, terrifying.
    HOWEVER, they messed up her character so badly at the end of part one in the manga. To make her ultimate motive "to be loved and have a family" is just lazy writing.
    It made no sense and didn't fit her character at all, and I'm gonna be upset about it for a while.</p>

<p>3. Kimblee: Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
    <img src = "kimblee.png" alt = "kimblee"
    width = 400
    height = 300 />
    <p>He has a moral code he sticks to, even if it's actually insane. He's am incredibly rational thinker who genuinely just loves violence,
    and I can respect that. He's on the side that best serves him, and he's aware of that fact. His speech to Roy Mustang while they are in Ishval?? Bone-chilling.</p>
